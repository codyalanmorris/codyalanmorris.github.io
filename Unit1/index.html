  <h1>About Cody Morris</h1>
  <p>Im a Graphic Designer, living in Chicago. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because when thinking about some of my favorite websites (Pitchfork, Stereogum, AVClub) I often think about how much effort and work it goes into making one of these things.  It would be really awesome to someday begin my own site.</p>

  <h2>My Mission</h2>
