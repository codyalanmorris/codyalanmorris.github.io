	<h2>What two Websites are You Most Inspired By?</h2>
	<p><a href="www.pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a> and <a href="www.avclub.com">The AVClub</a>.</p>
	<h2>How Do They Exhibit Effective Use of Space, Size, and Balance?</h2>
	<p> For both of these websites, there is a lot of content for the viewer to digest.  The content is constantly changing, and there is a lot of it to sift through.  What I like about both of these websites, is their effectiveness in gravitating you to the most important thing they want you to see, even if there is much more on the page to look at.  For Pitchfork, you immediately notice their newswire, which normally has the most important story at the top left side of the page and uses an image corresponding with that image as more of a headline than the actual headline.  AVclub does the same thing.  The page uses a grid of images with text overlated on them to grab the viewers attention.</p>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>I would say the most notable difference is the fact that AVClub takes a lot more advantage of ads and user generated search results as well as a comment section in order to drive traffic.  Pitchfork, aside from banners and full page ads does not really dive into that part of the money making that a lot of websites are doing nowadays.  Pitchfork also does not have a comments section, which is awesome.</p>
	<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail 1</strong><li>
 <img src="thumbnails-01.jpg" alt="Thumnail 1" style="width:720px;height:405.5px">
 		<p>This one demostrates heierarchy by making a big left side space where a focal image/headline can be used.  It demonstrates heirarchy by having more important things be bigger than less important things.  It shows balance by having different size shapes and not just one size across the whole page.</p>
 		<li><strong>Thumbnail 2</strong></li>
 		<img src="thumbnails-02.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 2" style="width:720px;height;405.5px">
 		<p>This one demonstrates heirarchy, balance and a focal point by being more minimalistic than the first one. You see a list of content to click on all the way to the left and 2 large pieces of content on the right to choose from.</p>
